<h2><strong>And should You Consider Buying a Diesel Sedan?</strong></h2>



<p>When you think of diesel, you generally think of big ol’ semis bellowing huge plumes of black smoke down Route 66, right? It might surprise some to learn that diesel vehicles—specifically passenger cars—have been a popular alternative to gas cars for years now, but is that popularity starting to waver?</p>



<p>Many companies continue to push out diesel cars despite past scandals like Dieselgate and Volkswagen’s circumvention of emission laws. Plus with the rise of the fully electric vehicles liquid-fuel powered vehicles as a whole have a bleak horizon. So, what are the problems and advantages of diesel fuel, and should you buy a diesel sedan or compact?</p>



<h3>Pros & Cons</h3>



<p>While there are some amazing advantages to having a diesel-powered car, there are also drawbacks that could make or break your purchase.</p>



<h4>Cons</h4>



<ul><li>The price of diesel fuel is often the first thing to turn hopeful buyers away. According to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAA Gas Prices</a>, the current average price of diesel in the US is about $2.84. Just a year ago it was pushing upwards of an average of almost $3.00!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines produce higher amounts of toxic Nitrogen Oxides which, unlike, Carbon Dioxide, is immediately harmful to humans.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines run at higher temperatures than regular gas engines, so keeping up with oil, oil filter, air filter, and coolant changes can be detrimental to the health of your engine in the long run.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Buying a diesel sedan or coupe from companies like Mercedes and Volkswagen will usually mean that it is factory turbocharged. With a turbocharged diesel, you can’t just turn the car on and hammer the gas. These cars aren’t good at cold starts and need to idle for a couple of minutes before running.</li></ul>



<h4>Pros</h4>



<ul><li>While the base prices of diesel fuel are higher than those of regular gas, the efficiency of diesel engines can net you 10-15% in savings even with that added cost.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines run a lot cleaner in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions than regular fuel engines (with the exception of cars involved in Dieselgate). As of recently, companies have been getting a lot better at controlling their Nitrogen Oxide emissions as well.</li></ul>



<ul><li>As we mentioned earlier, diesel engines require a little more maintenance than gas engines. However, if you maintain your diesel car properly, they can last up to 2 times longer than gas engines.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Old VW turbodiesel Golfs have been recorded reaching mileages near 800-900k with no issues!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Stock turbocharged engines are usually smaller than their gas counterparts, and it’s through the turbocharger that it can provide its great performance and simultaneous fuel economy.</li></ul>



<h3>Misconceptions</h3>



<p>As we mentioned before, people tend to think of big trucks and dark black smoke. This could understandably lead some to steer away from diesel on the basis that it seems dirtier.</p>



<p>We mentioned diesel emissions in the Pros & Cons section, but let’s take a close look. Back in the 90s, the EU promoted diesel vehicles as a more environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline vehicles based upon the fact that diesel produces less Carbon Dioxide than gas ones. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean they’re all that clean. While the greenhouse gas emissions may be lower, diesel engines produce much more toxic materials like Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, and various Nitrogen Oxides which are harmful to humans.</p>



<p>Certainly makes you realize why rolling coal is illegal.</p>



<h3>The Rise of Hybrid and Electrics</h3>



<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past decade, you would’ve noticed the prominent surge in hybrid and fully electric vehicles as of late. Since the technology’s advancing so rapidly, the prices are dropping just as quickly and getting a fully electric vehicle is seeming like a truer reality to more and more Americans each day.</p>



<p>The one downside right now is the lack of cheap electrics on the used market. The cheapest you can get these days is 2011 Chevy Volt at an average of $7,000-8,000. Meanwhile, you can get a used Volkswagen Jetta TDI for around $2,500. In my opinion, it’s much more worth it to just go for the electric so you don’t have to pay for fuel all the time, but there are always arguments to the contrary.</p>



<p>Electric and hybrid cars are pretty ugly, let’s be honest, and the whir of an (admittedly powerful) electric engine isn’t nearly as satisfying as the pickup truck-like rev of a diesel sedan engine. As the years progress, diesel and gas cars or going to collectively phase-out. So, if you want longevity, technology, and cost-saving then maybe go for an electric. Or try out a janky gas-to-electric conversion.</p>
