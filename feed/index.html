<h2><strong>Elon Musk, Brake or Bust?</strong></h2>



<p>Just about every folk in America and abroad knows about the well-spoken, anime loving, meme lord Elon-chan, but how does his car brand represent the future of the automotive industry and can they claim a top spot in the future of electric vehicles?&nbsp;</p>



<p>From the bottom to the top Tesla has been riding the EV wave to the leaderboard in the past few years with their unmatched pace for innovation in the electric market. With the relatively recent release of the Tesla Cybertruck, and subsequent stock price jump, it really seemed like Tesla could ride this wave forever. However, it might surprise many to learn that Tesla isn’t too good at doing what companies are generally made to do- generating profit.</p>



<h3>Tesla Profit Margins</h3>



<p>Now, the fact the Tesla sells the most popular electric vehicles of all time is irrefutable. Despite the significantly large time gap between the Nissan Leaf (the second most popular electric vehicle), which was released in December 2010 and the release date of the Tesla Model 3 in September of 2017, the Model 3 has managed to not only catch up to but surpass the Leaf total global sales. Even if you narrow it down to just the North American market, Tesla’s Model 3 still comes out on top over the Model S, Chevy Volt, and Nissan Leaf once more. So shouldn’t they be making bank?</p>



<p>Tesla started 2019 off with major cost-cutting measures to keep the company from going under within the year and missed their estimated revenue in the first quarter by about $650million. The second quarter wasn’t so forgiving either, netting Tesla another $408million loss in revenue. By the end of 2019, Tesla was still unable to turn a profit, with a total loss of $862million by the end of the year.</p>



<p>According to Donna Hull and Tom Randall of Automotive News, one of the main culprits seems to be Tesla’s pioneering “direct-to-consumer sales” system which bypasses third-party dealerships, opting for Tesla-run shops where consumers can only buy directly from Tesla itself. On paper it seems like an amazing idea; no dealerships marking up the MSRP prices, no sly-tongued salesmen making commissions selling their souls to sell you the most expensive model, and more salary-based jobs within the Tesla company. Unfortunately, it’s not all sunshine and rainbows as these Tesla-operated stores are apparently cutting deep into Musk’s pockets, forcing the closure of many across the country.</p>



<h3>The $35k Promise</h3>



<p>Probably the single biggest issue at Tesla right now is the confusion with the Tesla Model 3 Standard Range version. Back in March of 2016, they unveiled the Model 3 with a starting price of $35,000USD. However, as most know now, it actually released with a base price of around $40,000. Early in 2019, Tesla did finally release their $35,000 model, three years after promised, but to this day there remains a lack of clarity in purchasing this version of the Model 3 as it isn’t directly purchasable on Tesla’s website. Car Confections covers the detail more in-depth in <a rel="noreferrer noopener" href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w_-_t29bciw" target="_blank">this video</a>.</p>



<h3>Competitors</h3>



<p>While Tesla has admittedly made leaps and bounds in terms of EV technology, its established competitors haven’t been idly standing by to enjoy the show. Following the Dieselgate scandal we mentioned in our article on diesel cars <a href="https://automerican.xyz/cars-and-trucks/is-it-worth-it-buying-a-diesel-car-in-2020/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">here</a>, Volkswagen decided to swear off diesel and gas-powered vehicles to pursue the electric market in hopes of re-branding as an environmentally friendly brand. Many other brands have also recently dipped into the electric market.</p>



<p>Companies like Nissan and Chevy began experimenting with electric consumer vehicles years ago, but as more and more companies hop on the bandwagon the element of competition is starting to fill the air. It seems like every couple of months there’s a new EV announced. A new Chevy Volt here, a VW E-Golf there, here have a Rivian electric pickup truck! With all these new introductions to the market, it’s hard to tell who might come out on top, but we’re fairly sure it won’t be Tesla.</p>

<h2><strong>And should You Consider Buying a Diesel Sedan?</strong></h2>



<p>When you think of diesel, you generally think of big ol’ semis bellowing huge plumes of black smoke down Route 66, right? It might surprise some to learn that diesel vehicles—specifically passenger cars—have been a popular alternative to gas cars for years now, but is that popularity starting to waver?</p>



<p>Many companies continue to push out diesel cars despite past scandals like Dieselgate and Volkswagen’s circumvention of emission laws. Plus with the rise of the fully electric vehicles liquid-fuel powered vehicles as a whole have a bleak horizon. So, what are the problems and advantages of diesel fuel, and should you buy a diesel sedan or compact?</p>



<h3>Pros &amp; Cons</h3>



<p>While there are some amazing advantages to having a diesel-powered car, there are also drawbacks that could make or break your purchase.</p>



<h4>Cons</h4>



<ul><li>The price of diesel fuel is often the first thing to turn hopeful buyers away. According to <a href="https://gasprices.aaa.com/" target="_blank" rel="noreferrer noopener">AAA Gas Prices</a>, the current average price of diesel in the US is about $2.84. Just a year ago it was pushing upwards of an average of almost $3.00!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines produce higher amounts of toxic Nitrogen Oxides which, unlike, Carbon Dioxide, is immediately harmful to humans.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines run at higher temperatures than regular gas engines, so keeping up with oil, oil filter, air filter, and coolant changes can be detrimental to the health of your engine in the long run.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Buying a diesel sedan or coupe from companies like Mercedes and Volkswagen will usually mean that it is factory turbocharged. With a turbocharged diesel, you can’t just turn the car on and hammer the gas. These cars aren’t good at cold starts and need to idle for a couple of minutes before running.</li></ul>



<h4>Pros</h4>



<ul><li>While the base prices of diesel fuel are higher than those of regular gas, the efficiency of diesel engines can net you 10-15% in savings even with that added cost.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Diesel engines run a lot cleaner in terms of Carbon Dioxide emissions than regular fuel engines (with the exception of cars involved in Dieselgate). As of recently, companies have been getting a lot better at controlling their Nitrogen Oxide emissions as well.</li></ul>



<ul><li>As we mentioned earlier, diesel engines require a little more maintenance than gas engines. However, if you maintain your diesel car properly, they can last up to 2 times longer than gas engines.</li></ul>



<ul><li>Old VW turbodiesel Golfs have been recorded reaching mileages near 800-900k with no issues!</li></ul>



<ul><li>Stock turbocharged engines are usually smaller than their gas counterparts, and it’s through the turbocharger that it can provide its great performance and simultaneous fuel economy.</li></ul>



<h3>Misconceptions</h3>



<p>As we mentioned before, people tend to think of big trucks and dark black smoke. This could understandably lead some to steer away from diesel on the basis that it seems dirtier.</p>



<p>We mentioned diesel emissions in the Pros &amp; Cons section, but let’s take a close look. Back in the 90s, the EU promoted diesel vehicles as a more environmentally friendly alternative to gasoline vehicles based upon the fact that diesel produces less Carbon Dioxide than gas ones. Unfortunately, this doesn’t mean they’re all that clean. While the greenhouse gas emissions may be lower, diesel engines produce much more toxic materials like Hydrocarbons, Carbon Monoxide, and various Nitrogen Oxides which are harmful to humans.</p>



<p>Certainly makes you realize why rolling coal is illegal.</p>



<h3>The Rise of Hybrid and Electrics</h3>



<p>Unless you’ve been living under a rock for the past decade, you would’ve noticed the prominent surge in hybrid and fully electric vehicles as of late. Since the technology’s advancing so rapidly, the prices are dropping just as quickly and getting a fully electric vehicle is seeming like a truer reality to more and more Americans each day.</p>



<p>The one downside right now is the lack of cheap electrics on the used market. The cheapest you can get these days is 2011 Chevy Volt at an average of $7,000-8,000. Meanwhile, you can get a used Volkswagen Jetta TDI for around $2,500. In my opinion, it’s much more worth it to just go for the electric so you don’t have to pay for fuel all the time, but there are always arguments to the contrary.</p>



<p>Electric and hybrid cars are pretty ugly, let’s be honest, and the whir of an (admittedly powerful) electric engine isn’t nearly as satisfying as the pickup truck-like rev of a diesel sedan engine. As the years progress, diesel and gas cars or going to collectively phase-out. So, if you want longevity, technology, and cost-saving then maybe go for an electric. Or try out a janky gas-to-electric conversion.</p>
